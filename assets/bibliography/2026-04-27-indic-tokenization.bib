    abstract = "In this work, we provide a systematic and comprehensive empirical comparison of pretrained multilingual language models versus their monolingual counterparts with regard to their monolingual task performance. We study a set of nine typologically diverse languages with readily available pretrained monolingual models on a set of five diverse monolingual downstream tasks. We first aim to establish, via fair and controlled comparisons, if a gap between the multilingual and the corresponding monolingual representation of that language exists, and subsequently investigate the reason for any performance difference. To disentangle conflating factors, we train new monolingual models on the same data, with monolingually and multilingually trained tokenizers. We find that while the pretraining data size is an important factor, a designated monolingual tokenizer plays an equally important role in the downstream performance. Our results show that languages that are adequately represented in the multilingual model{'}s vocabulary exhibit negligible performance decreases over their monolingual counterparts. We further find that replacing the original multilingual tokenizer with the specialized monolingual tokenizer improves the downstream performance of the multilingual model for almost every task and language."

    abstract = "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has been predominantly driven by curating the training dataset composition, scaling of model architectures and dataset sizes and advancements in pretraining objectives, leaving tokenizer influence as a blind spot.Shedding light on this underexplored area, we conduct a comprehensive study on the influence of tokenizer choice on LLM downstream performance by training 24 mono- and multilingual LLMs at a 2.6B parameter scale, ablating different tokenizer algorithms and parameterizations. Our studies highlight that the tokenizer choice can significantly impact the model{'}s downstream performance and training costs. In particular, we find that the common tokenizer evaluation metrics fertility and parity are not always predictive of model downstream performance, rendering these metrics a questionable proxy for the model{'}s downstream performance. Furthermore, we show that multilingual tokenizers trained on the five most frequent European languages require vocabulary size increases of factor three in comparison to English. While English-centric tokenizers have been applied to the training of multi-lingual LLMs in the past, we find that this approach results in a severe downstream performance degradation and additional training costs of up to 68{\%}, due to an inefficient tokenization vocabulary."

    abstract = "Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceedingly well in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks for many languages including English. However, despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiy{\={a}}karaṇa dataset, thus created, consists of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show that instruction-tuning with Vaiy{\={a}}karaṇa improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7 percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve human-like performance in grammatical error identification. Humans, though, remain superior in error correction. The data and code are available from https://github.com/Bangla-iitk/Vaiyakarana."
